# MatrixProject - Introduction to Robotics

## Robotics Matrix Game Project - University of Bucharest, FMI  
### Introduction to Robotics (2025 - 2026)

Welcome to my LED Matrix game project developed for the **Introduction to Robotics** course!  
This repository contains the full implementation of my **8x8 LED Matrix Game**, built using **Arduino**, an **LCD display**, and **joystick input**, following the official project requirements.

This project will evolve throughout the semester, starting from a basic interactive demo for **Checkpoint 1** and expanding into a fully featured game with menus, settings, animations, and scoring.

## Project Overview

This repository is dedicated exclusively to the **Matrix Game Project**, which is a standalone project.

The project is built around:
- An **8x8 LED matrix controlled via MAX7219**
- A **16x2 LCD display** for menu and game information
- A **joystick** for navigation and control
- A **modular C++ architecture** using multiple classes for clean design

The goal is to develop a complete interactive game that includes:
- A visual **LCD-based menu system**
- **Joystick-controlled gameplay**
- **LED matrix animations**
- Progressive difficulty
- Highscore system
- Settings and sound control (to be added in later checkpoints)
